\section{Example Plots}
This section aims to give an easier understanding of how one can use plotXVG, using examples given by the test.py script found in the plotXVG GitHub repository. For each plot is also the exact plotXVG command for easy reproducibility. In order to run these successfully, you need to be in the tests directory. We hope this can further show the scope of plotXVG's abilities.
