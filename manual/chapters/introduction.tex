plotXVG is a command line tool based on the Matplotlib library as well as dependencies from the NumPy package meant to in part replace the Grace software to alleviate quick generations of plots from GROMACS generated xvg files, but supports csv files as well. It currently consists of 740 lines of Python code with an addition of testing of a test script.

Below follows the User Manual, an installation guide and practical usage of plotXVG including descriptions of all flags.

We hope this tool suits your needs!
